# **Hugging Face Backup**
<small> An extremely weird fork of content from Nocrypt's notebook, and as well as EveryDream2Trainer for JupyterLabs by a DID system that has no clue how to code. We'd call it opinionated! This is MISSING google stuff, we want to MAYBE add ocalmfuse to it eventually, it is NOW missing EMJOY finder because it's useless in a jupyter environment. (It is! LOL you can easy find stuff otherwise!)

*Quickly upload stuff like merged models to huggingface*

If you're on CivitAI, the version SHOULD be updated as soon as a version has been pushed :3

##  **HUGGING FACE HUB BACKUP** 


At the moment this only supports CHECKPOINTS, rather than full backups. This works on a local machine.
FOLDERS may only work in theory - for MODEL types (as in diffusers adn otherwise) rather than anything else.
VAST USERS: THIS ONLY WORKS ON JUPYTER LAB, NOT SERVER. BE AWARE THAT RUNPOD USES LAB BY DEFAULT.

### ☢☢ **MAKE SURE:** ☢☢

You create a huggingface token, go to [this link](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), then `create new token` or copy available token with the `Write` role.
