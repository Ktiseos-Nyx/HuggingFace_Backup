[![Model on HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/resolve/main/model-on-hf-xl-dark.svg)](https://huggingface.co/Duskfallcrew/Huggingface_Backup) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/duskfallcrew/HuggingFace_Backup)

This tool provides a user-friendly way to upload files directly to your Hugging Face repositories using a Jupyter Notebook. Designed to streamline your workflow, it makes sharing your models, datasets, and spaces easier than ever!

We are actively working on further development and security enhancements for the Jupyter Notebook edition.

We are also actively struggling to update and keep track of the Google Colab version.

> 2025 'EXTRA' is the version with the extra cell to zip up images or files before uploading to huggingface.  March 2025 has minor adjustments to environment code.
> Dataset Zipper is a standalone zip & download function notebook, which it's  cell is in the 'extra' notebook as well.

## üíª Jupyter Notebook Edition: Interactive and User-Friendly

For an interactive and visually intuitive experience, use our Jupyter Notebook edition. 


<br/>

### One-Time Setup for Jupyter Users

1.  **How To Get Your Huggingface API Token:**

    *   Navigate to your [Hugging Face settings page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
    *   Click "New token."
    *   Provide a descriptive name for your token (e.g., "Uploader Token").
    *   Select the appropriate role and permissions. For uploading files, ensure it has "write" permissions.
    *   Click "Generate token."
    *   **Securely copy the generated API token.** This token is essential for authentication and will only be displayed once. If lost, you will need to generate a new one.

2.  **Authentication:**  After generating your API token, execute the `notebook_login()` cell *once* at the beginning of the notebook. This securely stores your Hugging Face API token for the session.

    *   **Important Security Note:** To maintain the security of your API token, avoid sharing the notebook file or system state after running `notebook_login()`. **Do not commit the notebook to public repositories**, especially if using platforms like Google Colab. If you suspect your token has been compromised, generate a new one immediately.

### üóÇÔ∏è Using the Uploader Widget in the Jupyter Notebook

1.  **Repository Details:**
    *   **Owner:** Enter your Hugging Face Organization or Username. This is the name found in your repository URL.
    *   **Repo:** Enter the name of the repository you wish to upload to.
        *   Ensure both "Owner" and "Repo" names are accurate to prevent upload failures.
    *   **Repo Type:** Select the repository type from the dropdown menu: "model," "dataset," or "space."
    *   **Subfolder:** (Optional) To upload files to a specific subfolder within your repository, enter the subfolder name. If left blank, files will be uploaded to the repository root.

2.  **Directory Selection:**
    *   **Path:** Enter the full path to the local directory containing the files you want to upload.
    *   **Update Dir:** Click 'üîÑ Update Dir' to set the path and refresh the file list based on the selected file type.
        *   If no files appear, verify that the path and selected file type are correct.

3.  **File Selection:**
    *   **File Type:** Choose the appropriate file type from the dropdown (e.g., `safetensors`, `png`, `txt`). This will display all files of that type within the specified directory.
    *   **File List:** Select the files for upload from the displayed list. Use the "Sort By" dropdown to organize files by name or modification date.

4.  **Commit Message:**
    *   **(Optional):** Add a specific message for the commit in the "Message" field. If left empty, a default message "Uploaded with Earth & Dusk Huggingface ü§ó Backup" will be used.

5.  **Upload Options:**
    *   **Create Pull Request:** Check this box to upload changes as a pull request. Unchecked, changes are directly committed to the main branch.
    *   **Clear output after upload:** Select this option to clear the output area after a successful upload.

6.  **Start Upload:**
    *   Click '‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload' to begin the upload process.
    *   The current file being uploaded and the upload progress percentage will be displayed.

### üí° Important Notes for Jupyter Users

*   **Direct Uploads:** This tool utilizes the Hugging Face API for direct file uploads, bypassing Git operations for core functionality. Command-line Git usage is not required for basic uploads.
*   **Git LFS:** Git LFS is not necessary for using this tool.  Separate Git credentials are required for repository operations outside of this notebook (like cloning or pushing via Git) and should not be stored within the notebook.
*   **Subfolders:** The tool will create subfolders in your repository based on your local file structure or the specified "Subfolder."
*   **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter issues, re-verify all steps, ensure you have write access to the repository, and that your API token has the correct permissions. Double-check file paths and file types.
