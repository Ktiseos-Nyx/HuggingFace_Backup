# 🌟 HuggingFace Backup - Where Magic Happens!

Hey there, fellow adventurers! Welcome to our delightfully unique corner of the AI universe! 🚀

## 💫 What's This All About?
This is our cozy mashup of Nocrypt's notebook and EveryDream2Trainer, specifically tuned for JupyterLabs by a creative DID system who loves to experiment. Think of it as our "opinionated" take on things - because sometimes the best tools come with a bit of personality!

### 🎯 What We Do:
- Quick and easy uploads of merged models to Hugging Face
- Focus on checkpoints (not full backups)
- Made for local machine love
- Works with Jupyter environments (Amazon Sagemaker, Vast.Ai, Runpod, etc.)
- Not for Google Colab (but that's okay!)
