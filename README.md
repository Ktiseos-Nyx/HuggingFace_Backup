# **Hugging Face Backup**
<small> An extremely weird fork of content from Nocrypt's notebook by a DID system that has no clue how to code. We'd call it opinionated, but it's not a WebUI, so apart from ElFinder, free users should be able to use this.

## ***‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§***
*Quickly upload stuff like merged models to huggingface*
-----------------
<small>Code yoinked from Nocrypt, notebook literally just has his credits in there because we wanted a seperate notebook for backups besides just the stable diffusion settings. This includes some extra toys like Imjoy-Elfinder and Google Drive mount. We don't know how to code, and there may not be a TON of updates on this.

## ‚ô¶‚ô¶ **COLAB UPDATES** ‚ô¶‚ô¶
If you've copied this to drive and it's no longer working check here: https://github.com/kieranxsomer/HuggingFace_Backup
-----------------
### ‚úÖ **Mount Drive!**
This is extremely optional, but y'know if you need it! 

-----------------

### ‚úÖ **Imjoy-Elfinder**

An optional file viewer that may give you a more visual way of looking at your files. Also good if you need to upload files instead of using terminal or gdrive. 

-----------------

###  ‚úÖ **Hugging Face Hub Options**

‚ò¢‚ò¢ **How to use this colab** ‚ò¢‚ò¢

Scream, because i couldn't get "THE FUN WAY" To work.
Which is OK,  because the "MANUAL" way is faster. 
There is no need to actually fix code, or anything just copy and paste your details as instructed. 

‚ò¢‚ò¢ **MAKE SURE:** ‚ò¢‚ò¢

You create a huggingface token, go to [this link](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), then `create new token` or copy available token with the `Write` role.

üîº Run cell `1,2,3`

You only need to choose one between `3.2,and 3.3`

Note 3.1 was yoinked because right now I don't know how to patch it to work outside of a stable diffusion instance.  If you're using a free colab, try not to use the File Finder - as that's probably considerd a "REMOTE UI"

Make sure you `MOUNT` your google drive, I've patched in `Imjoy-Elfinder` for kicks. - Visual people like this, I know I do.
