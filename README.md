# HuggingFace_Backup
Code yoinked from Nocrypt, notebook literally just has his credits in there because we wanted a seperate notebook for backups besides just the stable diffusion settings.  This includes some extra toys like Imjoy-Elfinder and Google Drive mount.  We don't know how to code, and there may not be a TON of updates on this.
