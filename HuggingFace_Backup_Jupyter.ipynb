    "# **Hugging Face Backup**\n",
    "<small> An extremely weird fork of content from Nocrypt's notebook, and as well as EveryDream2Trainer for JupyterLabs by a DID system that has no clue how to code. We'd call it opinionated! This is MISSING google stuff, we want to MAYBE add ocalmfuse to it eventually, it is NOW missing EMJOY finder because it's useless in a jupyter environment. (It is! LOL you can easy find stuff otherwise!)  BOTH VERSIONS will work on Colab, but Jupyter only works on NON google instances. Jupyter version won't connect to your google drive - it'll only connect to a certain folder.  I'm working on things, I don't know how to program *CRIES*. \n",

    "*Quickly upload stuff like merged models to huggingface*\n",

    "1. Run the first cell and paste your token into the prompt.  You can get your token from your [huggingface account page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).\n",
    "2. You'll need to note in \"REPO\" where you're uploading to - please go TO your model page or sorry your user page, create a new repo.  This means that unlike colab, where it can CREATE ONE - somehow on jupyter lab it's easier to just have one pre created.\n",
    "3. At this stage it can only tolerate ONE type of file PER box, so safetensors for one, pt files for another etc (Three's three boxes)\n",
