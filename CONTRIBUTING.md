*   **Testing:** Help test the code to ensure quality and identify bugs.
*   **Answering Questions:** Assist other users in the issues or community forums.

## Issue Guidelines

Before creating an issue, please search to see if a similar one already exists. When creating a new issue:

*   **Use a clear and descriptive title.**
*   **Provide a detailed description of the problem or suggestion.**
*   **Include steps to reproduce the bug (if applicable), including code snippets.**
*   **Specify your environment (OS, Python version, package versions).**
*   **Add relevant screenshots or error messages.**

## Pull Request Guidelines

*   **Keep pull requests small and focused.**
*   **Base your work on a feature branch.**
*   **Write clear commit messages** (see [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines)).
*   **Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request.**
*   **Ensure your code adheres to our [Coding Style](#coding-style) (PEP 8, docstrings, notebook best practices).**
*   **Add tests** if applicable.
*   **Make sure all existing tests pass.**
*   **Be responsive to feedback.**
*   **Squash commits if necessary** before merging.

## Development Setup

### Using a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. You can create one using `venv` (built-in) or `conda` (if you're using Anaconda/Miniconda):

**Using `venv`:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment named .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the environment (macOS/Linux)
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the environment (Windows)
```
** Using conda:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.9  # Replace 3.9 with your desired Python version
conda activate myenv
```

### Installing Dependencies
Install the project's dependencies using pip and the provided requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to install additional packages for development, it is good practice to add them to a requirements-dev.txt file (or similar) and install them with pip install -r requirements-dev.txt.

## Working with Jupyter Notebooks

Launch Jupyter:


```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or if you prefer Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

- Kernel: Ensure that you're using the correct kernel (the virtual environment you created) within the notebook.

- nbconvert: If you need to convert notebooks to other formats (e.g., Python scripts, HTML), you can use nbconvert:

```bash
  jupyter nbconvert --to script mynotebook.ipynb
```
- Clear Outputs before Committing: To prevent large diffs and potential merge conflicts arising from stored cell outputs, it's recommended to clear the outputs of all cells in your notebook before committing. You can do this manually within Jupyter by selecting "Kernel" -> "Restart & Clear Output" or use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --inplace mynotebook.ipynb
```

- Consider nbstripout: If you want to automate the clearing of notebook outputs, you can use the nbstripout tool. Install it using pip:
```bash
pip install nbstripout
```

- Then, install it as a Git filter in your repository, which will automatically remove outputs whenever you commit a notebook:

```bash
nbstripout --install
```
This will modify your repository's .gitattributes file to use nbstripout as a filter for .ipynb files.
- Note: If your team members are working with nbstripout, they must also install the filter for it to work correctly on their end.

## Notebook Best Practices

- Keep notebooks concise and focused on a specific task or analysis.


- Use Markdown cells to provide clear explanations, context, and narrative.


- Organize code into logical sections with headings.


- Avoid long code cells; break them into smaller, more manageable chunks.


- Use meaningful variable names.


- Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic.


- Restart the kernel and run all cells before submitting a pull request to ensure reproducibility.


- If your notebook generates large outputs or intermediate data files, consider excluding them from version control (using .gitignore).


- Consider testing your notebooks automatically using tools like nbval.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix: Resolve issue with data loading").


- Keep the subject line short (under 50 characters).


- Wrap the body at 72 characters.


- Explain why the change was made, not just what was changed.


### Use a conventional commit format such as:


- feat: for new features


- fix: for bug fixes


- docs: for documentation changes


- style: for code style changes (e.g., formatting)


- refactor: for code refactoring


- test: for adding or updating tests


- chore: for maintenance tasks (e.g., updating dependencies)

Example:
```bash
fix: Handle missing values in data processing
The previous data processing pipeline did not correctly handle missing values, leading to inaccurate results. This commit adds a step to impute missing values using the mean of each column, ensuring that the analysis is more robust.
```

**Important Notes for Python/Jupyter Projects:**

*   **Virtual Environments:** Emphasize the importance of virtual environments for dependency management.
*   **`requirements.txt`:**  Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file (and consider `requirements-dev.txt` for development-specific packages).
*   **PEP 8:** Reinforce the importance of following PEP 8 for Python code.
*   **Notebook Best Practices:** Provide specific guidance on using Jupyter Notebooks effectively within the project.
*   **Testing:** If you have tests (especially for notebooks), explain how to run them.
*   **Documentation:** If you use a documentation generator (like Sphinx), provide instructions on how to build the documentation.
