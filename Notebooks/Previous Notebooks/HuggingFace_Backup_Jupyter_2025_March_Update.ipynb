    "# 🚀 Welcome to the Hugging Face File Uploader!\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading files directly to your Hugging Face repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Started (One-Time Setup):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Install Dependencies:**\n",
    "    *   Run the first code cell in this notebook to install the required libraries (`huggingface_hub`, `ipywidgets`, etc.).  You only need to do this *once* per environment.\n",
    "2.  **Authenticate with Hugging Face:**\n",
    "    *   Run the `notebook_login()` cell (usually the second cell).  This will prompt you for your Hugging Face API token.\n",
    "    *   Get your API token from your [Hugging Face settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) (make sure it has **write** access).\n",
    "    *   **🚨 Security:** After logging in, *never* share your notebook file (`.ipynb`) or commit it to a repository.  The `notebook_login()` function handles your token securely, but sharing the notebook could still expose sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the Uploader:**\n",
    "\n",
    "See the detailed instructions in the \"🚀 Using the Hugging Face File Uploader\" section below.  The key steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Enter Repository Details:** Provide your username/organization, repository name, and type.\n",
    "2.  **Select a Directory:** Specify the folder containing your files.\n",
    "3.  **Choose Files:** Select the files you want to upload.\n",
    "4.  **Set Upload Options:** Choose whether to create a pull request and clear output.\n",
    "5.  **Click \"⬆️ Upload\":** Start the upload process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features & Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Direct Uploads:** This uploader uses the Hugging Face API for direct file uploads. You don't need to use `git` commands directly for basic uploads.\n",
    "*   **Interactive Interface:** The uploader provides a user-friendly interface within the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "*   **Progress Tracking:**  You'll see real-time progress updates during the upload.\n",
    "*   **Error Handling:**  Detailed error messages will help you troubleshoot any problems.\n",
    "* **Troubleshooting** If you encounter issues, double-check your credentials, repo name, write permissions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Community & Support:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **GitHub:** [Ktiseos Nyx @ Github](https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/HuggingFace_Backup) (for updates, bug reports, and contributions)\n",
    "*   **Discord:**\n",

    "# ✨ Connecting to Hugging Face: Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "To upload files to Hugging Face, you need to authenticate with your Hugging Face API token.  This token grants your notebook secure access to the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔑 Get Your API Token**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Go to your Hugging Face settings:** [Hugging Face Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).\n",
    "2.  **Find \"Access Tokens\":** Locate the section labeled \"Access Tokens\".\n",
    "3.  **Create or Copy:**\n",
    "    *   If you don't have a token, create a new one with **write** access.  *Crucially, you need write access to upload.*\n",
    "    *   If you have an existing token, copy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔒 Login to Hugging Face in this Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Run the next cell:** Execute the code cell immediately below this one.\n",
    "2.  **Paste your token:**  A prompt will appear.  Paste your copied API token into the input field.  *You won't see any characters as you type or paste – this is for security.*\n",
    "3.  **Press Enter:** This completes the login process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚨 Important Security Notes 🚨**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why you need to log in:** This login authorizes *this notebook environment* to interact with the Hugging Face Hub on your behalf.  It's required for uploading.\n",
    "*   **Session-specific:** The login is only valid for the *current notebook session*.  If you restart the kernel or open the notebook later, you'll need to log in again.  The token is *not* stored within the notebook itself, enhancing security.\n",
    "*   **`notebook_login()` is secure:** The `notebook_login()` function from the `huggingface_hub` library handles the token securely. It does *not* store the token in plain text within the notebook.\n",
    "*   **Do NOT share your notebook:** After logging in, **never** share your notebook file (`.ipynb`) with others or commit it to a public (or even private, but shared) repository.  While the token isn't *directly* visible in the notebook file, the notebook's internal state might contain information that could be used to compromise your account.  Treat the logged-in notebook as a sensitive document.\n",
    "* **Do not store the token in your code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Authentication Errors:** If you encounter authentication issues after entering your API token:\n",
    "    *   **Local Development:** If you are running Jupyter Notebook on your *own computer*, open your system terminal (Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows).\n",
    "    *   **Rented GPU / Cloud Environment:** If you are using a *rented GPU service* (Paperspace, RunPod, Google Colab, etc.), open a terminal *within your Jupyter environment*.  This is usually done through a \"New\" -> \"Terminal\" option in the Jupyter file browser.\n",
    "    *   **Run this command (in the appropriate terminal):**\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        git config --global credential.helper store\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        This configures Git to store credentials, which can sometimes resolve conflicts. It does *not* store your Hugging Face token in plain text. It's a general Git configuration setting. If you are still concerned with security, you may remove this credential after.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Still having trouble?** Consider refreshing your Hugging Face token (creating a new one and deleting the old one) on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), and then try logging in again with the new token. This is a good security practice if you suspect your token might have been compromised."

    "\n",
    "These instructions guide you through uploading files to your Hugging Face repository using the interactive uploader in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites (Must be completed first):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **✅ Authenticated with Hugging Face:** You must have successfully logged in using the `notebook_login()` cell at the beginning of this notebook.\n",
    "*   **✅ Repository Created:** You must have already created the repository on the Hugging Face Hub where you want to upload files.  *The uploader does not create repositories.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Repository Details (Top Section):**\n",
    "    *   **Owner:** Enter your Hugging Face username *or* the name of an organization you belong to.\n",
    "    *   **Repo:** Enter the *exact name* of your Hugging Face repository (e.g., `my-cool-model`).\n",
    "    *   **Repo Type:** Choose the correct type for your repository: `model`, `dataset`, or `space`.\n",
    "    *    **Subfolder (Optional):** If you want to upload files to a *subfolder* within your repository, enter the subfolder name here.  Leave this blank to upload to the root of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Select the Directory (Middle Section):**\n",
    "    * **Path:** Type or paste the *full path* to the directory on your system (or within the Jupyter environment) that contains the files you want to upload.\n",
    "    * **Update Dir button:** *Click this button* to set the directory. This is very important. The uploader uses this path to find your files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Choose Files (Middle Section):**\n",
    "    *   **File Type:** Select the correct file type from the dropdown menu (e.g., SafeTensors, PyTorch Models).  This filters the file list.\n",
    "    *   **Sort By:** Choose how to sort the file list (by name or date).\n",
    "    *   **File List:**  A list of files matching your selected type and directory will appear.  *Select the files you want to upload* by clicking on them.  You can select multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Commit Message (Optional):**\n",
    "    * **Message:** Type a short description of your upload. This is a good practice for tracking changes. If you don't put in a message, a generic message will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Upload Settings (Bottom Section):**\n",
    "    *   **Create Pull Request:**\n",
    "        *   **Checked:**  Your files will be uploaded to a *new branch*, and a pull request will be created.  This is recommended for collaboration and reviewing changes before merging them into the main branch.\n",
    "        *   **Unchecked:** Your files will be uploaded *directly* to the `main` branch of your repository.  Use this with caution, especially for shared repositories.\n",
    "    *   **Clear output after upload:**\n",
    "        *  **Checked:** The output will be cleared a few moments after the upload is complete.\n",
    "        * **Unchecked:** The output will remain.\n",
    "    *  **Update Files Button:** Updates the file list.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Upload! (Bottom Section):**\n",
    "    *   Click the **⬆️ Upload** button to start the upload process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**During and After Upload:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Progress:** You'll see progress updates, including the currently uploading file, a percentage, and a visual progress bar.\n",
    "*   **Errors:**  If any errors occur, they will be displayed in the output area, along with details to help you troubleshoot.\n",
    "*   **Completion:**  Once the upload is complete, you'll see a success message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uploading More Files:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reuse the uploader to upload additional files to the *same* repository or a *different* repository. Just repeat the steps above, adjusting the settings as needed."
