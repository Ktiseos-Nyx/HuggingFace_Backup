    "# **Hugging Face Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our peculiar repository! \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a unique amalgamation of content from Nocrypt's notebook and EveryDream2Trainer for JupyterLabs, curated by a diverse DID system with a passion for experimentation. We affectionately call it \"opinionated,\" reflecting our unconventional approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this repository is to facilitate the quick upload of merged models to Hugging Face. While our focus is on functionality, we prioritize simplicity and accessibility. Currently, this repository supports checkpoints rather than full backups, optimized for local machine usage. There is different diffusers edition that has not been updated in a while, but functionality is similar to this one.  This notebook is limited to Jupyter Enivronments, and is not set up to work with Google Colab.  This will work on Amazon Sagemaker, Vast.Ai, Runpod & anywhere that supports Jupyter Labs. \n",
