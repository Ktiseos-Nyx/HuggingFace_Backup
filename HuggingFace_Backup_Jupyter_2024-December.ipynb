    "\n",
    "Hey there, fellow adventurers! Welcome to our delightfully unique corner of the AI universe! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💫 What's This All About?\n",
    "This is our cozy mashup of Nocrypt's notebook and EveryDream2Trainer, specifically tuned for JupyterLabs by a creative DID system who loves to experiment. Think of it as our \"opinionated\" take on things - because sometimes the best tools come with a bit of personality!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What We Do:\n",
    "- Quick and easy uploads of merged models to Hugging Face\n",

    "-----------------\n",
    "Hey there, fellow tinkerers! Let's get your workspace ready for some AI magic! ✨\n",

    "Sometimes things don't go quite according to plan (because computers, am I right?), and you might find yourself missing a piece of the puzzle. If that happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a deep breath - we've all been there!\n",

    "## 💝 A Little Note from Us\n",
    "Here's the thing - we're more like creative problem-solvers than traditional programmers. Think of us as the MacGyver of code - we might not have the fanciest solution, but we'll find a way to make it work! \n",

    "## 🎯 Remember\n",
    "- Updates are coming regularly\n",
    "- Your patience means the world to us\n",

    "Hey there, fellow ML adventurer! 🚀 Before we can start flinging files across the HuggingFace universe, we need to get you properly equipped with your special access key! \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 First Things First: Getting Your Token\n",
    "Think of this like getting your own personal teleportation device (but for files, because we're not quite there with humans yet... sadly 😅)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Zoom over to your [HuggingFace account settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)\n",
    "2. Find that shiny \"Access Tokens\" section (it's where all the cool kids hang out)\n",
    "3. Create a new token or grab your existing one\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 The Login Dance\n",
    "Run the cell below and when prompted, paste in your token. Don't freak out when you don't see anything appear - it's playing ninja 🥷 with your credentials (super secret spy stuff, you know?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just hit enter after pasting and *voilà*! You're in! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:** ⭐ Think of this login step as your secret handshake with HuggingFace. You'll need to do this little dance anytime you want to:\n",

    "- Generally do anything cool with HuggingFace 😎\n",

    "-----------------\n",
    "### First Stop: Creating Your Repository\n",
    "Before we dive into the file uploading magic, let's get your Hugging Face house in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Head over to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and log in to your account\n",
    "2. Visit your profile page (think of it as your HF home base!)\n",
    "3. Click the [New Model](https://huggingface.co/new) button\n",
    "4. Give your repository a memorable name (you'll need this later!)\n",
    "5. Set up your permissions (public/private - your choice!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Unlike Google Colab, our Jupyter notebook needs a pre-existing repository to work its magic. Think of it like preparing the landing pad before launching your files! 🛸\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Our Shiny New Uploader\n",
    "Now that you've got your repository ready, here's how to use our streamlined uploader:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Repository Details** 📚\n",
    "   - Fill in your Organization/Username\n",
    "   - Add your Repository name (the one you just created!)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **File Selection** 🗂️\n",
    "   - Pick your file type from the dropdown (SafeTensors, PyTorch, etc.)\n",
    "   - Choose how to sort your files (by name or date)\n",
    "   - Select the files you want to upload from the list\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Upload Settings** 🚀\n",
    "   - Want to create a Pull Request? Just tick the checkbox!\n",
    "   - Hit the \"Upload\" button and watch your files take flight!\n",
    "\n",
    "The uploader will keep you posted with friendly messages about how things are going. If anything goes sideways, it'll let you know what happened and how to fix it! \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Your repository needs to exist before you start uploading - think of it like having your destination ready before starting your journey! ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to upload more files later? No problem! Just repeat these steps whenever you need to send more files to your repository. Easy peasy! 🎯\n"
